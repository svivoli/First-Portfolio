### User Experience

The user is greeted by the home page which contains a short bio and an image beneath an "About Me" title. At the top is a navbar that contains my name on the left and links to navigate to the other pages on the right. All of the pages have a main white div containing the main content which is centered over the grey background.

The portfolio page contains project examples which are laid out on a grid. The examples are displayed as pictures of the sites with overlay labels that are linked to the projects. When clicked, the projects open in a new tab.

The contact page contains 3 cards within a grid. The first card has my email address and phone number. The second card has links to my LinkedIn profile and a view only Google doc of my resume. These links are in the form of FontAwesome icons, one being the LinkedIn logo, and one being a written document. The third card is a form where the user can submit their name, email address, and a message.


### Developer Experience

First Project Experience:

As my first project I faced about as much challenge as I expected to, mainly in css. The header took me a fair bit of time, especially the navigation links which were to be separated by those pesky little lines. I also faced some challenges with the images on the portfolio page. They wanted to overlap the header when the user scrolled down the page, and the formatting in general wasn't all that easy. Once I got into the groove of it I was able to work at a pretty impressive pace, I have to say, so the portfolio and contact pages took way less time than the first page, minus the hiccups. The wonder of coding is that there are many ways to get the same result, which can make it feel like the code is wrong even when it turns out right. "Am I donig this right..." I asked myself about a hundred times... but I think it came out okay! Hope you get the chance to let me know what you think.

Later Additions Experience:

Changes made:
* Added UIKit CSS Framework
* Added LinkedIn and Resume
* Changed colors and fonts
* Made responsive
