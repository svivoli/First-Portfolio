# Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my very first major project which showcases my portfolio website.

### Description

The site features a home page and two additional pages which can be navigated to using the nav bar at the top of the page. The purpose of this site is to create a space to showcase my work and who I am as a programmer and to make available a platform for employers, clients, fellow coders, and other viewers to contact me.

Content (by page):
1. About Me (Main page)
2. Portfolio page
3. Contact page

Page-Specific Attributes:
1. Bio with picture
2. Linked project examples - pictures with labels contained in a table
3. Contact submission page - name, email, and message forms; submit button

Other Attributes:
* Header with navigation bar
* Headings
* Colors, fonts, borders
* Margins, padding
* Super cool background
* Sticky footer

### My Experience

As my first project I faced about as much challenge as I expected to, mainly in css. The header took me a fair bit of time, especially the navigation links which were to be separated by those pesky little lines. I also faced some challenges with the images on the portfolio page. They wanted to overlap the header when the user scrolled down the page, and the formatting in general wasn't all that easy. Once I got into the groove of it I was able to work at a pretty impressive pace, I have to say, so the portfolio and contact pages took way less time than the first page, minus the hiccups. The wonder of coding is that there are many ways to get the same result, which can make it feel like the code is wrong even when it turns out right. "Am I donig this right..." I asked myself about a hund#C5B09D times... but I think it came out okay! Hope you get the chance to let me know what you think.
